# 3.-Maximal-sum-of-elements
Program should find the maximum sum of elements in line from the list of lines.

Program will take path to file as input (user can enter path in console application or send as command line interface argument if they exist).

Each line of the file contains a number set (number separator is comma, decimal separator is point).

Result should be the number of the line with a maximum sum of elements in line.

If line contains non numeric elements - line marked as broken.

As a separate list, write a number of lines with non numeric elements (“wrong elements”).
